  ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kander87 but my real name is Kate Anderson. I am making the career change into software development after being in education for 12 years. Funny enough, after teaching an intro CS course for the past 5-6 years to high school students and having many go on to college to study CS degrees, I am now completing a bootcamp to go into the field myself!
